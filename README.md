# Simple Server
This is a simple server with an /exampleService route that can serve as a stub for any simple app that could benefit from a running node server.  

## Setup
> npm install

## Run
> npm start

## Use
Once your server is running, from your request client of choice (browser, Postman, curl, etc.) try to make a request to:
> localhost:8080/
or
> localhost:8080/exampleService
